[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) is a free, open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development.
This repository is a structured collection of my code, and completed projects as I progress through it.

As I continue learning, I plan to revisit earlier challenges and projects to refactor or improve them using my newly gained knowledge.

## What's Inside

- Hands-on projects from the curriculum
- A record of my growth from a beginner to a full-stack developer

## Topics Covered

- HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Grid
- JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Git, GitHub, and collaboration workflows
- Node.js, Express, and backend basics
- Full-stack projects with databases
- Final portfolio and deployment
